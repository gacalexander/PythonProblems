Part 1 of 2: Processing an HTML file
One of the richest sources of information is the Web! In this notebook, we ask you to use string processing and regular expressions to mine a web page, which is stored in HTML format.

Note 0. The exercises below involve processing of HTML files. However, you don't need to know anything specific about HTML; you can solve (and we have solved) all of these exercises assuming only that the data is a semi-structured string, amenable to simple string manipulation and regular expression processing techniques. In a future notebook, you'll see a different method that employs the Beautiful Soup module.

Note 1. Following Note 0, there are some outspoken people who believe you should never use regular expressions on HTML. Your instructor finds these arguments to be overly pedantic. For an entertaining take on the subject, see this blog post.

Note 2. The data below is a snapshot from an older version of the Yelp! site. Therefore, you should complete the exercises using the data we've provided, rather than downloading a copy directly from Yelp!.

The data: Yelp! reviews. The data you will work with is a snapshot of a recent search on the Yelp! site for the best fried chicken restaurants in Atlanta. That snapshot is hosted here: https://cse6040.gatech.edu/datasets/yelp-example

If you go ahead and open that site, you'll see that it contains a ranked list of places:

Top 10 Fried Chicken Spots in ATL as of September 12, 2017

Your task. In this part of this assignment, we'd like you to write some code to extract this list.

Getting the data
First things first: you need an HTML file. The following Python code opens a copy of the sample Yelp! page from above.

import hashlib

with open('yelp.htm', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    yelp_html = f.read().encode(encoding='utf-8')
    checksum = hashlib.md5(yelp_html).hexdigest()
    assert checksum == "4a74a0ee9cefee773e76a22a52d45a8e", "Downloaded file has incorrect checksum!"
    
print("'yelp.htm' is ready!")
Viewing the raw HTML in your web browser. The file you just downloaded is the raw HTML version of the data described previously. Before moving on, you should go back to that site and use your web browser to view the HTML source for the web page. Do that now to get an idea of what is in that file.

If you don't know how to view the page source in your browser, try the instructions on this site.

Reading the HTML file into a Python string. Let's also open the file in Python and read its contents into a string named, yelp_html.

with open('yelp.htm', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as yelp_file:
    yelp_html = yelp_file.read()
    
# Print first few hundred characters of this string:
print("*** type(yelp_html) == {} ***".format(type(yelp_html)))
n = 1000
print("*** Contents (first {} characters) ***\n{} ...".format(n, yelp_html[:n]))
Oy, what a mess! It will be great to have some code read and process the information contained within this file.

Exercise (5 points): Extracting the ranking
Write some Python code to create a variable named rankings, which is a list of dictionaries set up as follows:

rankings[i] is a dictionary corresponding to the restaurant whose rank is i+1. For example, from the screenshot above, rankings[0] should be a dictionary with information about Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken.
Each dictionary, rankings[i], should have these keys:
rankings[i]['name']: The name of the restaurant, a string.
rankings[i]['stars']: The star rating, as a string, e.g., '4.5', '4.0'
rankings[i]['numrevs']: The number of reviews, as an integer.
rankings[i]['price']: The price range, as dollar signs, e.g., '$', '$$', '$$$', or '$$$$'.
Of course, since the current topic is regular expressions, you might try to apply them (possibly combined with other string manipulation methods) find the particular patterns that yield the desired information.

assert type(rankings) is list, "`rankings` must be a list"
assert all([type(r) is dict for r in rankings]), "All `rankings[i]` must be dictionaries"
