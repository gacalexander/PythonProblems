Supplemental notes on Pandas
The pandas library is a Python module for representing what we call "tibbles" in Topic 7. Beyond what you see there, this notebook has additional notes to help you understand how to manipulate objects in Pandas. These notes adapt those found in the recommended text, Python for Data Analysis (2nd ed.), which is written by the createor of pandas, Wes McKinney.

Versions. The state of pandas is a bit in-flux, so it's important to be flexible and accommodate differences in functionality that might vary by version. The following code shows you how to check what version of pandas you have.

import pandas as pd  # Standard idiom for loading pandas

print("=== pandas version: {} ===\n".format(pd.__version__))

import sys
print("=== Python version ===\n{}".format(sys.version))
The main object that pandas implements is the DataFrame, which is essentially a 2-D table. It's an ideal target for holding the tibbles of Topic+Notebook 7, and its design derives in part from data frame objects in the R language.

In addition to DataFrame, another important component of pandas is the Series, which is essentially one column of a DataFrame object (and, therefore, corresponds to variables and responses in a tibble).

from pandas import DataFrame, Series
Series objects
A pandas Series object is a column-oriented object that we will use to store a variable of a tibble.

obj = Series([-1, 2, -3, 4, -5])
print(f"`obj` has type `{type(obj)}`:\n\n{obj}")
Observe the common base type (dtype: int64) and index (element numbers).

Regarding the base type, a Series differs from a Python list in that the types of its elements are assumed to be the same. Doing so allows many operations on a Series to be faster than their counterparts for list objects, as in this search example.

from random import randint
n_ints = 10000000
max_value = 5*n_ints

print(f"""
Creating random `list` and `Series` objects:
- Length: {n_ints} elements
- Range: [{-max_value}, {max_value}]
""")
a_list = [randint(-max_value, max_value) for _ in range(n_ints)]
a_series = Series(a_list)

print("==> Estimating time to search the `list`:")
t_list_search = %timeit -o randint(-max_value, max_value) in a_list

print("\n==> Estimating time to search the `Series`:")
t_series_search = %timeit -o a_series.isin([randint(-max_value, max_value)])

print(f"\n==> (`list` time) divided by `Series` time is roughly {t_list_search.average / t_series_search.average:.1f}x")
If you create a Series with "mixed types," the dtype will become the most generic Python type, object. (A deeper understanding of what this fact means requires some knowledge of object-oriented programming, but that won't be necessary for our course.)

obj2 = Series([-1, '2', -3, '4', -5])
obj2
If you want to query the base type, use:

print(obj.dtype)
print(obj2.dtype)
Regarding the index, it provides a convenient way to reference individual elements of the Series.

By default, a Series has an index that is akin to range() in standard Python, and effectively numbers the entries from 0 to n-1, where n is the length of the Series. A Series object also becomes list-like in how you reference its elements.

print("obj.index: {}".format(obj.index))
print("range(0, 5): {}".format(range(0, 5)))
print("==> obj[2]:\n{}\n".format(obj[2]))
print("==> obj[3]:\n{}\n".format(obj[3]))
print("==> obj[1:3]:\n{}\n".format(obj[1:4]))
You can also use more complex index objects, like lists of integers and conditional masks.

I = [0, 2, 3]
obj[I] # Also: obj[[0, 2, 3]]
I_pos = obj > 0
print(type(I_pos), I_pos)
print(obj[I_pos])
However, the index can be a more general structure, which effectively turns a Series object into something that is "dictionary-like."

obj3 = Series([      1,    -2,       3,     -4,        5,      -6],
              ['alice', 'bob', 'carol', 'dave', 'esther', 'frank'])
obj3
print("* obj3['bob']: {}\n".format(obj3['bob']))
print("* obj3['carol']: {}\n".format(obj3['carol']))
In fact, you can construct a Series from a dictionary directly:

peeps = {'alice': 1, 'carol': 3, 'esther': 5, 'bob': -2, 'dave': -4, 'frank': -6}
obj4 = Series(peeps)
print(obj4)
mujeres = [0, 2, 4] # list of integer offsets
print("* las mujeres of `obj3` at offsets {}:\n{}\n".format(mujeres, obj3[mujeres]))
hombres = ['bob', 'dave', 'frank'] # list of index values
print("* hombres, by their names, {}:\n{}".format(hombres, obj3[hombres]))
I_neg = obj3 < 0
print(I_neg)
print(obj3[I_neg])
Because of the dictionary-like naming of Series elements, you can use the Python in operator in the same way you would a dictionary.

Note: In the timing experiment comparing list search and Series search, you may have noticed that the benchmark does not use in, but rather, Series.isin. Why is that?

print('carol' in peeps)
print('carol' in obj3)
Basic arithmetic works on Series as vector-like operations.

print(obj3, "\n")
print(obj3 + 5, "\n")
print(obj3 + 5 > 0, "\n")
print((-2.5 * obj3) + (obj3 + 5))
A Series object also supports vector-style operations with automatic alignment based on index values.

print(obj3)
obj_l = obj3[mujeres]
obj_l
obj3 + obj_l
Observe what happened with undefined elements. If you are familiar with relational databases, this behavior is akin to an outer-join.

Another useful transformation is the .apply(fun) method. It returns a copy of the Series where the function fun has been applied to each element. For example:

abs(-5) # Python built-in function
obj3 # Recall
obj3.apply(abs)
obj3 # Note: `.apply()` returned a copy, so the original is untouched
A Series may be named, too.

print(obj3.name)
obj3.name = 'peep'
obj3
When we move on to DataFrame objects, you'll see why names matter.

DataFrame objects
A pandas DataFrame object is a table whose columns are Series objects, all keyed on the same index. It's the perfect container for what we have been referring to as a tibble.

cafes = DataFrame({'name': ['east pole', 'chrome yellow', 'brash', 'bar crema', '3heart', 'spiller park pcm'],
                   'zip': [30324, 30312, 30318, 30030, 30306, 30308],
                   'poc': ['jared', 'kelly', 'matt', 'julian', 'nhan', 'dale']})
print("type:", type(cafes))
print(cafes)
display(cafes) # Or just `cafes` as the last line of a cell
The DataFrame has named columns, which are stored as an Index (more later!):

cafes.columns
Each column is a named Series:

type(cafes['zip']) # Aha!
As you might expect, these Series objects should all have the same index.

cafes.index
cafes.index == cafes['zip'].index
cafes['zip'].index == cafes['poc'].index
You may use complex indexing of columns.

target_fields = ['zip', 'poc']
cafes[target_fields]
But slices apply to rows.

cafes[1::2]
The index above is, by default, an integer range.

cafes.index
cafes2 = cafes[['poc', 'zip']]
cafes2.index = cafes['name']
cafes2.index.name = None
cafes2
You can access subsets of rows using the .loc field and index values:

cafes2.loc[['chrome yellow', 'bar crema']]
Alternatively, you can use integer offsets via the .iloc field, which is 0-based.

cafes2.iloc[[1, 3]]
Adding columns is easy. Suppose every cafe has a 4-star rating on Yelp! and a two-dollar-sign cost:

cafes2['rating'] = 4.0
cafes2['price'] = '$$'
cafes2
And vector arithmetic should work on columns as expected.

prices_as_ints = cafes2['price'].apply(lambda s: len(s))
prices_as_ints
cafes2['value'] = cafes2['rating'] / prices_as_ints
cafes2
Because the columns are Series objects, there is an implicit matching that is happening on the indexes. In the preceding example, it works because all the Series objects involved have identical indexes.

However, the following will not work as intended because referencing rows yields copies.

For instance, suppose there is a price hike of one more '$' for being in the 30306 and 30308 zip codes. (If you are in Atlanta, you may know that these are the zip codes that place you close to, or in, Ponce City Market and the Eastside Beltline Trail!) Let's increase the price there, on a copy of the dataframe, cafes3.

cafes3 = cafes2.copy()
cafes3
is_fancy = cafes3['zip'].isin({30306, 30308})
# Alternative:
#is_fancy = cafes3['zip'].apply(lambda z: z in {30306, 30308})
is_fancy
cafes3[is_fancy]
# Recall: Legal Python for string concatenation
s = '$$'
s += '$'
print(s)
cafes3[is_fancy]['price'] += '$'
What does that error message mean? Let's see if anything changed.

cafes3
Nope! When you slice horizontally, you get copies of the original data, not references to subsets of the original data. Therefore, we'll need different strategy.

Observe that the error message suggests a way!

cafes3.loc[is_fancy, 'price'] += '$'
cafes3
A different approach. For pedagogical purposes, let's see if we can go about solving this problem in other ways to see what might or might not work.

cafes4 = cafes2.copy() # Start over
cafes4
Based on the earlier discussion, a well-educated first attempt might be to construct a Series with a named index, where the index values for fancy neighborhoods have an additional '$', and then use string concatentation.

fancy_shops = cafes4.index[is_fancy]
fancy_shops
fancy_markup = Series(['$'] * len(fancy_shops), index=fancy_shops)
fancy_markup
cafes4['price'] + fancy_markup
Close! Remember that missing values are treated as NaN objects.

Exercise. Develop an alternative scheme.

# Preliminary observation:
print("False * '$' == '{}'".format(False * '$'))
print("True * '$' == '{}'".format(True * '$'))
cafes4 = cafes2.copy()
cafes4['price'] += Series([x * '$' for x in is_fancy.tolist()], index=is_fancy.index)
cafes4
More on apply() for DataFrame objects. As with a Series, there is a DataFrame.apply() procedure. However, it's meaning is a bit more nuanced because a DataFrame is generally 2-D rather than 1-D.

cafes4.apply(lambda x: type(x)) # What does this do? What does the output tell you?
A useful parameter is axis:

cafes4.apply(lambda x: type(x), axis=1) # What does this do? What does the output tell you?
And just to quickly verify what you get when axis=1:

cafes4.apply(lambda x: print(x) if x.name == 'east pole' else None, axis=1)
Exercise. Use DataFrame.apply() to update the 'value' column in cafes4, which is out of date given the update of the prices.

cafes4 # Verify visually that `'value'` is out of date
def calc_value(row):
    return row['rating'] / len(row['price'])

cafes4['value'] = cafes4.apply(calc_value, axis=1)
cafes4
Another useful operation is gluing DataFrame objects together. There are several helpful operations covered in Notebook 7; one not mentioned there, but useful in one of its exercises, is .concat().

# Split based on price
is_cheap = cafes4['price'] <= '$$'
cafes_cheap = cafes4[is_cheap]
cafes_pricey = cafes4[~is_cheap]

display(cafes_cheap)
display(cafes_pricey)
# Never mind; recombine
pd.concat([cafes_cheap, cafes_pricey])
More on index objects
A pandas Index, used by Series and DataFrame, is "list-like." It has a number of useful operations, including set-like operations (e.g., testing for membership, intersection, union, difference):

from pandas import Index
cafes4.index
cafes4.index.isin(['brash', '3heart'])
cafes4.index.union(['chattahoochee'])
cafes4.index.difference(['chattahoochee', 'starbucks', 'bar crema'])
If you need to change the index of a DataFrame, here is one way to do it.

cafes5 = cafes4.reindex(Index(['3heart', 'east pole', 'brash', 'starbucks']))

display(cafes4)
display(cafes5)
Observe that this reindexing operation matches the supplied index values against the existing ones. (What happens to index values you leave out? What happens with new index values?)

Another useful operation is dropping the index (and replacing it with the default, integers).

cafes6 = cafes4.reset_index(drop=True)
cafes6['name'] = cafes4.index
cafes6
Fin! That's the end of these notes. With this information as background, you should be able to get through Notebook 7.
